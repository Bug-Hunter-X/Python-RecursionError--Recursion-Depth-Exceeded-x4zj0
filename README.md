# Python RecursionError Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the `RecursionError`.  The `bug.py` file contains a recursive function that does not handle negative inputs correctly, resulting in infinite recursion and an error.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version of the function.
